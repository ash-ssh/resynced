# Resynced
Fabric mod that aims to fix common issues when lagging in Minecraft multiplayer.
### Implemented Fixes
Break progress resetting upon server updating item durability (significantly slows breaking on high ping!)<br/>
Data tracker sending local player pose updates (causes double blocking/sneaking)<br/>
Pingless eating
### TODO
Pingless hurt animation (override hurt animation and sound on attack and cancel the incoming one) maybe critical/magic particles too?<br/>
Built-in settings menu
